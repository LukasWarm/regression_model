Case Study: Regression

This project is a part of the Ironhack Data Analytics bootcamp and can be found on the following repository: [**Mid-bootcamp project - Regression**](https://github.com/ironhack-edu/data_mid_bootcamp_project_regression). This includes all necessary files used for this project. 



## Project Intro/Objective

The goal of this project is to build a a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated. The dataset consists of 22,000 properties sold between May 2014 to May 2015 in Washington.

## Methods Used

- Machine Learning
- Data Visualization
- Predictive Modeling



## Technologies

- Python
- Dbeaver, MySQL
- Pandas, jupyter notebook
- Tableau
- OLS Model (regression)
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor



## Approach

For this project I needed to determine which factors are responsible for higher property value and price. I tested the assumption that location, property size and quality were signficant factors that could determine price. I started off by using as many features that fit this assumption as well as testing the multicollinearity of my data. I then used different models and removed features to compare and improve the model.
